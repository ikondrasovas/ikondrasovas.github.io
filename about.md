My name is Igor Kondrasovas. As a Software Engineer and entrepreneur, I am helping small fabricators create smart factories. I work out of my home office in [Porto](http://www.cm-porto.pt/cidade), Portugal at [Otimize Nesting](http://www.otimizenesting.com). I blog about things I am experiencing and hopefully worth sharing.

If you just want to contact me, go ahead!.
