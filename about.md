My name is Igor Kondrasovas. I am a software engineer and entrepreneur in training. I work out of my home office in [Porto](http://www.cm-porto.pt/cidade), Portugal at [Otimize Nesting](http://www.otimizenesting.com). I blog about things I am experiencing and hopefully worth sharing.

If you just want to contact me, go ahead!.
