The good, the bad, the ugly

"What is the point of splitting user stories, if you have to do everything anyway?"

Why user stories must be splitted?

Before Sprint
1 - In refinement, to have a flow, otherwise is waterfall

During
1 - We discovered new things. These things we do not know if they are important, or if the made other thing less important. Example:
1.1 - This new things are tech stuff, so the effort increase Example:
1.2 - This new thing will require upfront work, so we have an internal dependency. Address this first and the rest later. Example:

2 - We did not discover new things, still this dam thing is taking longer then expected. Example:

Splitting does not mean "leaving for the next sprint", but it means that we are returning undone work to the backlog to be discussed, refined, estimated and prioritized again.

Respect the other things on the backlog that are waiting for their chance to come to the world!

Objection: Yes, but then I will have to test all over again, that is overkill
Objection: I want the whole cake, no matter if you split in 8 or 16 pieces.
