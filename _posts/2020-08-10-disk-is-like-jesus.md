![Floppy Disks are Like Jesus](../images/disksarelikejesus.jpg)

I remember when I was teaching Introduction to Informatics discipline to Production Engineering students at [UDESC](https://joinville.udesc.br). One day I asked:

Why the local disk you have in your PC is named as "C:"? Why not "A:" or "B:"?

I received no answer back, so then I had to tell them about floppy disks. I am wondering if this generation (and newer ones) had ever asked themselves why this weird symbol is used to save documents?

If good icons are known to be good metaphors for real or physical things most of the times, then maybe this will break the rule and just be like it is for "historical reasons".

PS: Maybe some asks about why not A or B in the comments.
