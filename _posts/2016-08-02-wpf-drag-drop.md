## WPF Drag and Drop

This post shows how to drag DataGrid rows to a listbox. The listbox shows a collections of "Materials" and the DataGrid contains parts for each material. What I want to accomplish here is to allo user change the material for a part, just draging the part records from the grid to the new Material type.
