## Free Book: Continuous Delivery with Windows and .NET

Yesterday I read [this interesting book about continuous deliver](http://www.oreilly.com/webops-perf/free/continuous-delivery-with-windows-and-net.csp).

I know I am on debt about reading books, so I cannot give a strong opinion about it, but what I liked is how simple and direct the authors puts their personal impresions about different products and technologies as well specific practs you should and should not do. 

I am strongely considering using this book as guidance for the steps I must go to have continuous delivery for real in my projects.

Good reading.
