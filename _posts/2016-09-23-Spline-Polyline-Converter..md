The [best book](https://pomax.github.io/bezierinfo/) I know about BÃ©zier Curves is free and online. It is interactive and well explained, since the introduction.

[Autodesk](http://www.autodesk.com/) also provides under the [MIT license](https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT) a [Fusion 360 add-in](https://github.com/AutodeskFusion360/DXFSplineToPolyline_Python)
