I am in the process of adding multilingual capabilities to this website thanks to [this great post](https://www.sylvaindurand.org/making-jekyll-multilingual/)

It is not everything explained in details, so for me that am not very familiar with Jekyll, gems, bundle etc. etc there were some things that seemed pretty easy, but I spent some great deal of time on them.

Anyway, thanks to the author!
