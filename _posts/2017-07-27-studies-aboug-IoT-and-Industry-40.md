We want to create a new part List

1 - Muliple row drag and drop
2 - Reorder rows
3 - New item placeholder with keyboard support
4 - Tab navigation
5 - Full row selection on mouse over
6 - Colum Sort on header click
7 - Disable editing when  part is DXF
8 - Full row validation

We identified that a ListView (GridView) [does not support cell keyboard navigation](https://blogs.msdn.microsoft.com/atc_avalon_team/2006/03/13/editing-in-listview/).

We are now looking at ItemsControl template
