Recently I read [this book](https://www.amazon.com/Pregnancy-Instruction-Manual-Troubleshooting-Parents/dp/1594742456) and found it great!

Me and my wife decided to read it a couple of week after discovering we are going to be parents. Obviously my wife read much quicker than I did, but I made question to at least keep up and being a couple of steps in front of what was actually happening with us.
