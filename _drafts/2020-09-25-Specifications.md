#Specifications in Scrum

Specifications is a contract between who is writing the specification and who is consuming this specification.

Consumers could be:
Software developers, so they know what changes on the system behavior are required.
Technical documentation team, so they know what to right to help people using the software;
Customer support team, so they know the possible implications and changes on the software behavior;

Usually specifications are created to map user requirements. Basically these requirements are there so we know what the software should do, but not how it should be done. They map the customer expectations.


How we can empiricism if we have a specification to follow? How can we work in fact-based, experience-based and evidence-based if we have to read an interpret a document that is by nature incomplete and probably wrong?
