Last year I received an e-mail from the Microsoft Partner Network, saying they will be migrating my membership management from the Partner Membership Center (PMC) to Partner Center. No changes on the benefits or subscriptions.

A work account would be necessary. I alread had one, so I use it and follow the steps by the book.

There were some steps required on AzureAd that I had to perform in the Azure Portal, I do not remember exactly what were, but at the end I realized there was a new Azure AD tennant in my Azure portal (that I log with my personal account (the same I was using for the microsoft partner))

There was a [Guide for this migration](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/partner-center/guide-to-migration?wt.mc_id=&cr_cc=WPGM_PRM_GL_NN_TR_NN_OO_EM_here&mkt_tok=eyJpIjoiTldRMVltWmxNek5qTjJJMSIsInQiOiJOVk9sSlN1M0F6SE5rSEdOYnM4SDdcLzB5eHRHQ09JWUMydTN1XC9ZNktiVGxzU2swTnRQcXRBVTZZbjI1TjNOYzhYcGdKSHN5bDljTTdhUHRvcVZLTXNINFhYdGJ6NXlHamQzbkhEZFhqTVBMSEJHM2xaY0RiRGE4STZldjFWd1JBIn0%3D) with more details here.

By reading it, I realized I may have missed to add a custom domain and become a global admin.
